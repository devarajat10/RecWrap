# RecWrap
This project is an implementation of RecWrapper library which is a wrapper for recycler view adapter and currently handles different viewtypes for recyclerView, and handles the click listners on each item.
This project can be improved and extended in many areas with time.

**Eg: Screenshot with 5 view types**
